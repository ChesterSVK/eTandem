This folder is used for defining all helper data and functions that will be available on the client side only.
For requirements purposes and learning purposes React components were integrated into the blaze components.
If needed all react components can be changed to blaze components to keep the code diversity lower.
All blaze components are listed in the views/ directory. These blaze files then use react components for rendering the data.
All client side database models are defined in the models/ directory.
There is a route file prepared to defined all custom needed routes for tandem administration.
